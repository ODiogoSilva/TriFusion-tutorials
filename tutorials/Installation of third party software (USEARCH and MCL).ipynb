While MCL is already distributed with TriFusion and should work out of the box, the licensing of USEARCH does not allow it to be bundled.

    "1. [Download the cygwin1.dll](https://github.com/ODiogoSilva/TriFusion/raw/master/trifusion/data/resources/mcl/windows/cygwin1.dll) file and place it in  TriFusion's user directory, which should be in _C:\\Users\\\\<USER\\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\trifusion_.

    "In most distributions, the MCL binary is already provided and should work out of the box. Nevertheless, if you get the warning message for MCL as well, follow these simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the MCL binary either from the mcl [website](http://micans.org/mcl/) (Unix systems) or from [TriFusion's repository](https://github.com/ODiogoSilva/TriFusion/tree/master/trifusion/data/resources/mcl). When downloading from the TriFusion repository, make sure you download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n",
