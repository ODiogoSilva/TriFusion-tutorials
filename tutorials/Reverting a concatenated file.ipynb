    "This method uses the partitions defined within TriFusion to reverse concatenate a single input alignment file. __Therefore, if you use this method, make sure only one alignment is loaded__. There are several ways to import or create partitions in TriFusion (check the User Guide, Section 4.3.2 _Partitions tab_). For instance, partitions may already be defined in a Nexus input file, in which case TriFusion will automatically detect them and set them in the _Partitions_ tab of the sidepanel. \n",
