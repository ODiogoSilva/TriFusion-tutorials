    "\n",
    "Most operations in TriFusion can be applied to either the total data set (all files and taxa currently loaded) or custom made data sets, named _active_ datasets. Active data sets can be defined in TriFusion in order to quickly apply operations on different sets of files and/or taxa. The definition of data set groups can serve multiple purposes that are highly user-specific, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- creating output files with or without outgroup taxa;\n",
    "- separating data sets with nuclear and mitochondrial alignments;\n",
    "- create alignments with only specific taxa families;\n",
    "- removing problematic files/taxa from output;\n",
    "- etc.\n",
